Perfect Scrambled Eggs
Serves 2 people (2 eggs per person)

- Ingredients

    4 large eggs fresh eggs are better
    2 tbsp milk or cream, 1/2 tbsp cream per egg
    3/4 tsp cornstarch (cornflour) scant 1/4 tsp cornstarch per egg
    1/4 tsp kosher salt
    pinch of sugar optional
    1 1/2 tbsp butter

- To Serve
    Cracked black pepper
    Chopped chives

- Instructions

    Place an 8 inch non-stick pan on the stove, and turn up the heat to medium to medium-high.

    Add the cornstarch and milk into a bowl or jug. Whisk to dissolve the cornstarch in the milk.

    Crack the eggs into the milk and add the salt (and sugar - which is optional).

    When the cooking pan is hot, blend the eggs for a few seconds using a hand blender or a mini blender. You can use a whisk or a fork to whisk the eggs as well, but the scrambled eggs will be creamier and smoother when blended.

    Add the butter into the hot pan, and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the eggs into the pan (before or as soon as the butter has melted - don't let the butter cook too long and turn brown).

    Using a spatula, start to stir the eggs from the outside in. Stir slowly, but continuously, to break the egg curds that are forming in the pan. If you feel the eggs are cooking too fast, remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir and mix the eggs. The eggs should be done in 1 minute.

    Remove the eggs from the pan while the eggs are still a little wetter than the consistency you prefer. This is because the eggs will continue to cook for a bit longer in the residual heat.

    Divide the eggs into two portions and sprinkle with either black pepper, chives or both. Serve with buttered toast.
